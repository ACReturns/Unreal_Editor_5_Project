#  Zombie Run
 This is a project utilizing Unreal Editor 5 fully utilizing blueprints as well as Blend Spaces and the Animation Graph to achieve what I was looking to do. While you can fight the enemies that are chasing you, 
 a majority of the time you're outnumbered to discourage standing your ground aside from when you only run into straggler enemies. A majority of the background was created via Quixel Bridge to have a 
 quick environment tunnel created to lay the groundwork for the player to run from the enemies.

- Damage Enemy: The blueprint for how damaging the enemy is tracked. Checking the current health value before making its greater than or equal to 1 before subtracting the damage and confirming the new health value
- was not equal to 0 before progressing, otherwise it would be destroyed.
