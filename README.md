#  Zombie Run
This project leverages Unreal Engine 5, making full use of blueprints, Blend Spaces, and the Animation Graph to realize my vision. While you can confront the enemies pursuing you, you'll often find yourself outnumbered, which discourages holding your ground except when dealing with isolated stragglers. Most of the environment was designed using Quixel Bridge to quickly create an underground tunnel, setting the stage for players to escape from their foes.

- Damage Enemy: This outlines the method for monitoring enemy damage. Before subtracting damage, verify that the current health value is greater than or equal to 1. Ensure that the new health value does not equal 0 before proceeding; otherwise, the enemy will be destroyed.
